# Hangman Game - Python CLI Version

This is a simple terminal-based Hangman game built using Python.  
The player must guess a secret word, letter by letter, within a limited number of attempts.  
The game includes category-based word selection, and automatic restart after each round.

## Features

- Random word selection from multiple categories (animals, fruits, objects, jobs, etc.)
- Colorful terminal output with ASCII-art hangman stages
- Restartable game session with user confirmation
- Clean and modular OOP design (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Easy to extend or modify for new categories and game logic

## Prerequisites

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
